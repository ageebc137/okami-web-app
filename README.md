#Okami Sanctions Solutions

##Welcome to Okami Sanctions Solution's open source code case!

Ōkami is a compliance resource tool which provides financial institutions (FIs) and non-FIs to search for information on individuals and entities listed by the U.S. Treasury, State and Commerce departments. The word Ōkami (狼) means wolf in Japanese and signifies the idea that Ōkami acts as a tool to hunt down blacklisted names so that companies can bolster their financial compliance and intelligence programs and stay compliant with sanctions regulations.

##Why Okami?
International trade sanctions have affected numerous companies over the years, resulting in millions of dollars in penalties as a consequence of non-compliance with government regulations. Just in 2018, companies paid approximately $61 million in penalties enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Whether you are a financial institution (FIs), such as a bank or credit union, or a non-FI, such as a trading company, Ōkami allows you to stay compliant with regulatory obligations by allowing you to search for blacklisted names to bolster your Know Your Business programs.

You can conduct sanctions searches such as Osama Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein in the following program lists:

Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC - Treasury)
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS - Commerce)
Bureau of International Security and Non-Profileration (ISN - State)
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC - State)
Features included in Ōkami after setting up user account:

Batch search up to 30 names using a dynamic list
Saving sanctions reports for future reference in user account
Printing sanctions reports
Lists in development: United Kingdom Her Majesty's Treasury, United Nations and European Union lists.
