    <h1 id="section-title"><i>About &#332;kami</i></h1>
      <p id="section-paragraph">&#332;kami is a sanctions resource tool which allows financial institutions (FIs)
        and non-FIs to search for information on individuals and entities listed by the U.S. Treasury, State and Commerce Departments,
        specifically the agencies of the <i> Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC - Treasury)</i>, <i>Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS - Commerce)</i>, <i>Bureau of International
        Security and Non-Profileration (ISN - State)</i> and <i>the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC - State)</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Financial and trade sanctions have affected numerous FIs and non-FIs over the years, resulting in millions of dollars in penalties as a consequence
        of non-compliance with government regulations. Just in 2018, companies paid approximately $61 million in OFAC penalties alone.
         <i>&#332;kami</i> (ç‹¼) means <i>wolf</i> in Japanese and signifies the idea that &#332;kami acts as
         a tool to help hunt down blacklisted names by conducting <i>single</i> and <i>bulk</i> searches.
