      <p>Allister Bernal started builidng &#332;kami in 2018 while learning how to code. Having had a background in financial risk and compliance, Bernal decided to build an
        easy-to-use sanctions tool to reinforce concepts he learned while programming, as well as applying his previous background. He has worked as a researcher and analyst
        for a couple financial institutions including the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Visa. He loves to learn and
        is currently transitioning into software development.
